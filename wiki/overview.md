# Wiki Overview

Navigation: [[index]] | [[hot]] | [[log]] | [[dashboard]]

---

## Purpose

This is the cosmic-brain demo vault. It demonstrates the [[LLM Wiki Pattern]] — a system for building persistent, compounding knowledge bases using Claude and Obsidian.

Run `/wiki` to scaffold this vault for your own domain and replace this overview.

---

## Current Seed Content

This vault ships with a seeded first ingest based on Nate Herk's breakdown of the Karpathy LLM wiki pattern.

**Concepts seeded:**
- [[LLM Wiki Pattern]] — the core architecture
- [[Hot Cache]] — session context mechanism
- [[Compounding Knowledge]] — why the pattern works

**Entities seeded:**
- [[Andrej Karpathy]] — originated the pattern

**Sources seeded:**
- [[Nate Herk LLM Wiki Transcript]] — practical demonstration of the pattern

## Current State

- Sources ingested: 1
- Wiki pages: 11
- Last activity: 2026-04-07 (cosmic-brain v1.1.0 initialized)

## Key Themes

**Knowledge compounds.** Unlike RAG, the wiki pre-compiles synthesis. Cross-references are already there. Contradictions are flagged. Every ingest enriches existing pages rather than adding isolated chunks.

**The hot cache is the force multiplier.** A ~500-word file captures recent context. New sessions start with full context at minimal token cost.

**Obsidian is the IDE, Claude is the programmer.** The graph view shows what's connected. The human curates sources and asks questions. Claude writes and maintains everything else.
